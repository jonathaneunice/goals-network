<a id="goals-relationships" class="anchor" href="#goals-relationships" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals Relationships</h3>

<p>This project visualizes relationships from a real-world dataset, mapping studied <em>elements</em> to related <em>goals</em>. There are thousands of elements, and about a dozen goals. The total is 5,771 nodes in the full data. </p>

<p>Beyond this particular set of relationships, this project demonstrates techniques typically needed to clean up "dirty data" prior to visualization, and to display it an an appealing fashion. </p>

<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h4>

<p>Basic data cleanups are done in <code>csvclean.py</code>, in Python (using its wonderful <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> tools). Column names are sanitized, data are trimmed of excess spaces, and columns 
that are known to be pointless are dropped. The script emits more hygienic CSV.</p>

<p><code>graph.js</code> does the heavy lifting, converting CSV into a JavaScript data structure suitable for the incomparable <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> and its force-directed graph layout.</p>

<p>Much of the visualization core is stock d3. But making things look "right" takes a little more work than just "hey! d3! do your thing!" Interesting aspects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The goal graphs are largely implied by, not explicit in, the data. 
Goal nodes must be purposefully created and managed; they don't just 
"fall out of" the input data.</li>
<li>Multiple classes/kinds of nodes. Goal nodes behave quite differently 
from element nodes. E.g. they are explicitly placed, they are much larger,
they are custom-labeled. Those aspects need significant tending.</li>
<li>Making sure goal nodes are the focus of the visualization, and so they're
locked into the center of the display. They do eventually move toward their
associated element nodes, but only after the simulation has "settled" a bit.</li>
<li>Force layout graphs with large numbers of nodes can have *tremendous*
virtual forces impinging on the nodes, especially in the first few ticks of an
animation, leading to wild visual oscillations, and pushing nodes apart. Taming
that early "Big Bang" period's a bit of an art. This visualization uses several
techniques, including pre-placing element nodes in the vicinity of their associated
goals, 
fixing the goal' nodes at the center as virtual anchors, and dynamically resizing
the viewing area (SVG `viewBox`) as the simulation progresses. It doesn't seek
to eliminate flutter as much as "keep it down to a dull roar."
</li>
<li>The graph is typically rendered in a "dark" style (color on dark background), 
which tends to highlight the subtler lines and smaller groupings that can be 
easily "washed out" in a lighter rendering on-screen. Reversed images are
available for printing on paper, where the reproduction process is less prone 
to overwhelming fine lines and color distinctions.</li>
<li>Andrew Brehaut's <a href="https://github.com/brehaut/color-js">color-js</a> library
is used to blend the colors of element nodes that connect to more than one
goal node. Ariel Aizemberg’s 
<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/aaizemberg/78bd3dade9593896a59d">study of
categorical colors</a>
(especially the ones favored by Google)
is used to set a pleasing categorical color scheme. Thanks also Google!
</li>
<li>**NB** This layout was designed to create static images for
presentation and publication, so it lacks some optimizations
common in fully interactive displays. The placement
algorithm, in particular, trades away rendering speed for
simplicity and time-to-market. It uses a simple
"wait for things to settle, then shift
goal nodes" approach.
